= Three Ruby usages

This talk describes three Ruby usages:

  * Implementing high-level interface by Ruby.
  * Using Ruby as a glue language.
  * Embedding Ruby into a C program for flexibility.

All of them have pros and cons. They are trade-off. If a case can
ignore cons, we will have pros for the case.

Most of Rubyists implement their Ruby applications only by Ruby. This
talk shows another options to use Ruby as your convenient tool. If you
know another options and trade-offs of them, you will implement your
Ruby applications more effectively.

This talk uses Droonga, a distributed full-text search engine, as a
sample application to describe these Ruby usages. Droonga uses these
three Ruby usages.
